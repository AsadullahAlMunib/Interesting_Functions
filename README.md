# Interesting_Functions

### The header files used in this code are:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <math.h>
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The `conio.h` header file is one of the header files used in this [Interesting_Functions.c](https://github.com/AsadullahAlMunib/Interesting_Functions/blob/main/Interesting_Functions.c) code.**
>
> **If you want to use it, make sure your compiler supports the `conio.h` header file.**

> [!TIP]
> ***If you don't have a compiler that supports `conio.h`, you can use the [Interesting_Functions_2.c](https://github.com/AsadullahAlMunib/Interesting_Functions/blob/main/Interesting_Functions_2.c) code.***
>
> - [x] ***All systems used by the `conio.h` header file are commented out here, so*** **this code won't clear the screen** ***at different times with function changes!***

+ **Watch the video description of the code on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/xY8MRdf1CeoabcGt/?mibextid=jmPrMh) or [YouTube](https://youtu.be/bcgFMbPHvYI?si=OOHzuSDuwl7pyjdO).**

**There are 11 types of functions in this code:**
> ***`And I will try to UPDATE and IMPROVE it, Insha'Allah.`***
****


## 1. Pyramid. 
> *You will get 6 types of Pyramid:*

**1. Full Pyramid.**

**2. Half Left Pyramid.**

**3. Half Right Pyramid.**

**4. Interval Full Pyramid.**

**5. Interval Half Left Pyramid.**

**6. Interval Half Right Pyramid.**

> *Every Pyramid you can get by 3 type of character:*

+ ***1. By * (star)***

+ ***2. By Number***

+ ***3. By Letter***
****


## 2. Prime Number. 
> *You will get 3 systems of Prime Numbers:*

**1. Check Prime Number.**

**2. Prime Number from Start (1).**

**3. Prime Number between Two Intervals.**

+ `A whole number greater than 1 that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers, that is called a prime number.`
****


## 3. String Length. 
**When you enter a message/string, it will calculate and show the length of the string.**

+ `A string is a sequence of characters and can contain letters, numbers, symbols and even spaces.`
****


## 4. Captcha by Math. 
**You will get two random numbers between 1 and 50. And it will provide you with Plus or Minus or Multiply.**
****


## 5. Numbers Type Show. 
**You can provide many numbers separated by space, and it will show you the number of Positive, Negative, Zero, Even and Odd.**
****


## 6. Password Generator. 
**Enter the length of the password you want. Then it will provide you with a randomly Generated Password.**
****


## 7. Message Repetition. 
**Enter your Message, and provide the number of times you want it to repeat, then you will receive the Message with the Repeated Number.**
****


## 8. Narcissistic Number. 
> *You will get 3 systems of Narcissistic Numbers:*

**1. Check Narcissistic Number.**

**2. Narcissistic Number from Start (1).**

**3. Narcissistic Number between Two ranges.**

+ `If a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits, that is a Narcissistic Number.`

	- `For Example:`

	- 371 = 3<sup>3</sup> + 7<sup>3</sup> + 1<sup>3</sup>

	 - 9474 = 9<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup> + 7<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup>
****


## 9. Number Guessing Game. 
> *The Number Guessing Game has 3 difficulties:*

**1. Easy: Range 1 to 50 and 10 Attempt.**

**2. Medium: Range 1 to 100 and 8 Attempt.**

**3. Hard: Range 1 to 200 and 6 Attempt.**

+ `The system selects a random number within the difficulty range, and you have a difficulty-based chance of trying to guess that number. When you are able to find that number, you get an attempt-based score. The maximum score is 100 on the 1st attempt. If you can't guess the number even though your attempts are over, you will see that random number with a sound.`
****


## 10. Mine Guessing Puzzle Game. 
> *The Mine Guessing Puzzle Game has 3 difficulties:*

**1. Easy: 5 Matrix & 5 Mine (Max).**

**2. Medium: 7 Matrix & 12 Mine (Max).**

**3. Hard: 9 Matrix & 25 Mine (Max).**

+ `The system will distribute difficulty wise Square of Dot. The dots have an under-organized random number and a difficulty-wise mine by star. You have to enter two numbers separated by space. The first number represents the line-number of up-and-down rows, and the second number represents the dot-number of left-and-right columns. When you enter those two numbers, the hidden character of that particular dot will be displayed. If that particular dot has a star, the game will be over with a sound. After the game is over, you will get your score, which is 1 for every number. Then you can see the all random number selection of every dot.`
****


## 11. Uppercase Lowercase Converter. 
> *You have 2 options to convert the letters case:*

**1. Every Letter Lowercase.**

**2. Every Letter Uppercase.**

+ `Enter your text and complete it by using a dot, otherwise the system will never stop getting input and never convert.`
